            <p className="text-lg">I have more than 12 years experience in the startups and the mobile game industry, having worked on popular titles such as Clash of Clans and The Walking Dead: No Man's Land, and founded three companies during that time.</p>
            <p className="text-lg">I started my career in gaming at Supercell in 2012 and advanced through the ranks at several gaming startups before founding my first game studio, Skunkworks, in 2019.</p>
            <p className="text-lg">Currently, I am working on a new company, Get Lost which is focused on a major growth opportunity in the book publishing space.</p>

            <p className="text-lg">Having been in the front seat of multiple gaming startups, I have grown a wealth of knowledge and experience in leadership and strategy development. Coupled with a strength in execution, I have been able to successfully take numerous concepts from ideation and bring them to life.</p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              One of my core strengths is the ability to build strategies, assemble teams, 
              and lead them to build highly performing games.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Underlying this is an obsession with research and data-driven product strategies. I excel at 
              identifying high-growth market opportunities and developing the strategies to capitalize 
              on them.
